# 🎨 CSS Advanced Styling Project

Welcome to the **CSS Styling Project**, a continuation of the "HTML, advanced" task from the ALX Front-End Web Development curriculum. This project focuses on applying advanced CSS techniques to transform a raw HTML structure into a visually stunning, fully styled web page.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is based on a professional design mockup created in Figma. You’ll implement the CSS styles as closely as possible to match the provided design, improving your skills in layout design, responsiveness, typography, and use of assets.

> **Note:** The HTML code was provided in the previous project ("HTML, advanced"). Your task now is to style it using CSS and integrate assets like fonts and images.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Use the given HTML code and apply custom CSS styles.
- Implement layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive behaviors based on the Figma design.
- Optimize styles for consistency across different screen sizes.
- Integrate custom fonts (`Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT`) and local image assets.
- Ensure semantic and accessible HTML structure is preserved or improved.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for design reference
- Local assets (images, logos, fonts)

## 🖼️ Assets & Resources

- **Figma design:** [Access the Figma file](#) *(replace with actual link if sharing publicly)*
  - If not already done, “Duplicate to your Drafts” in Figma for full access.
- **Images & logos:** [Download here](#) *(replace with actual download link)*
- **Fonts:**
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle-ot) *(or provide local path if available)*

## 📄 Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file (from the previous project, updated to include necessary images and class attributes).
- `styles/`: Directory for your CSS files.
- `images/`: Folder containing all assets like background images, logos, and illustrations.
- `fonts/`: Folder containing downloaded custom fonts.

## 🔍 Notes

- Some Figma values may appear as floating-point numbers — feel free to round them for practical use.
- Adjust or add HTML elements where necessary to match the design (e.g., `<img>` tags for logos).
- Organize and comment your CSS for readability and maintainability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To view the styled page locally:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure all assets (images/fonts) are in the correct folders.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
4. Inspect and adjust your CSS as needed for full design fidelity.
